    question: `Where do I work and what projects have I been involved in?`,
    answer: `Currently, I work as an Associate Software Engineer at Coditas Solutions. In this role, I have been involved in several projects. One notable project is the "Hydrafacial Privacy Policy App." In this project, I developed the privacy policy section, including the notice page and form page, using React and Next.js. I designed and implemented a user-friendly and dynamic notice page that explained the privacy policy and terms of service in clear language. Additionally, I created a dynamic form page that allowed users to submit requests related to their personal data, such as access, deletion, and correction requests. I also implemented localization in nine different languages for the app and added validation checks to ensure the accuracy and completeness of user submissions. Another project I have worked on is the "Coditas Clap" project, where I helped develop an internal rewards and recognition platform using React and Next.js. In this project, I created a user-friendly interface for employees to nominate their colleagues for outstanding work and for managers to approve or reject the nominations. I designed a dynamic interface that displayed information about past nominations and the current status of ongoing nominations. Furthermore, I incorporated gamification features like badges and leaderboards to encourage participation.`,
